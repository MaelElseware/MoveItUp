# Move It Up! 🧠💪

**A fun desktop application that combines trivia questions with physical exercises to keep you physically active during long work sessions.**

## 🤔 Why This App Exists

I can never seem to remember it... when I'm deeply focused on coding, I often forget to take breaks and move around. Hours can pass without me getting up from my chair... This sedentary behavior isn't just uncomfortable : **prolonged sitting has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and musculoskeletal problems**. Research shows that **sitting for extended periods can reduce blood circulation, weaken core muscles, and negatively impact posture and mental clarity**.

Rather than relying on willpower alone (which I clearly lack of), I created this gamified system to automatically remind me to move (itup) while keeping my brain engaged with fun questions.
We all tend to ignore notifications so asking a general culture question seemed like an interesting lever in order to force you to consider what's happening on screen.
But don't worry, the app will tell you X minutes (configurable) before a new exercise happens and if you are in a meeting you can using the window tray context menu to reset the timer.
The app also features an inactivity checker (mouse and keyboard input) which will stop the timer if you are gone for Y minutes (configurable).
